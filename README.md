## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy diet can be challenging. With an overwhelming number of recipes and
dietary information available, finding meals that meet individual nutritional needs and preferences is time-consuming
and often frustrating. Meal Mentor aims to simplify this process by providing personalized recipe recommendations based
on users' dietary requirements and nutritional goals.

## Problem Description

Many individuals struggle to plan meals that align with their dietary preferences, nutritional goals, and health
requirements. Whether someone is following a specific diet like keto, vegan, or Mediterranean, or trying to manage
macronutrient intake (e.g., high protein, low carb), finding suitable recipes can be a daunting task.

Existing recipe platforms often lack the ability to provide personalized recommendations that consider both dietary
restrictions and specific nutritional values. Users are left to manually sift through countless recipes, which is
inefficient and discouraging.

**Meal Mentor** addresses this problem by leveraging advanced technologies to deliver tailored recipe suggestions,
enhancing the user experience and promoting healthier eating habits.

### Dataset: Healthy Diet Recipes

This project utilizes
the [Healthy Diet Recipes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/healthy-diet-recipes-a-comprehensive-dataset)
dataset from Kaggle, offering a wide range of recipes tailored for various diets and cuisines, with a focus on healthy,
nutritious meal options. The original dataset included information on extraction day and time, which has been removed
for this use case as it was not essential. The data has also been cleaned to remove duplicates, resulting in a
streamlined version optimized for efficient use with language models.

#### Dataset Details:

- **Total Entries**: 7,805 unique recipes.
- **Subset for Application**: To reduce LLM calls and simplify usage, a random sample of 200 recipes was selected from
  the full dataset.

#### Columns:

- **Diet_type**: Specifies the type of diet each recipe supports (e.g., vegan, keto).
- **Recipe_name**: The name or title of the recipe.
- **Cuisine_type**: Indicates the cuisine the recipe is associated with (e.g., Mediterranean, Indian).
- **Protein(g)**: The amount of protein per recipe in grams.
- **Carbs(g)**: The amount of carbohydrates per recipe in grams.
- **Fat(g)**: The amount of fat per recipe in grams.

This refined dataset supports designing diet-specific meal plans, examining nutrient distributions, and exploring
healthy recipes across various dietary preferences and cuisines.

You can find the dataset under `data/data.csv`.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11**
- **Docker and Docker Compose**
- **OpenAI API Key**
- **Elasticsearch** (Docker image)
- **PostgreSQL** (Docker image)
- **Grafana** (Docker image)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/liminm/meal-mentor.git
   cd meal-mentor
   ```

2. **Copy the Template**

   Duplicate the `.env.template` file and rename the copy to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Open the `.env` file in your preferred text editor and replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration
   details.

   It is only required to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file. The other variables are optional and the current
   presets are application defaults.

   **Note:** If you want to run the FastAPI backend locally, you need to set `POSTGRES_HOST=localhost` in the `.env`
   file.

   **Note:** Ensure that your `.env` file is not committed to version control by adding it to your `.gitignore` file:

   ```gitignore
   # .gitignore
   .env
   ```

4. **Install Python Dependencies**

   For dependency management, we use pipenv, so you need to install it:

   ```bash
   pip install pipenv
   ```

   Once installed, you can install the app dependencies:

   ```bash
   pipenv install --dev
   ```

5. **Initialize the Database**

   Before the application starts for the first time, the database needs to be initialized.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up postgres
   ```

   Then in a new terminal window, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   cd meal_mentor
   export POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
   python db_prep.py
   ```

   *Ensure Docker containers are running before executing the script.*

6. **Build and Run Services with Docker Compose**

    **Important:** Ensure that `POSTGRES_HOST=postgres` in the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This starts the FastAPI application, PostgreSQL, and Grafana.

7. **Alternatively, you can run the FastAPI application locally:**

   First, change the `POSTGRES_HOST` in the `.env` file to `localhost`:

   ```env
   POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
   ```

   Start only PostgreSQL and Grafana:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up postgres grafana
   ```

   Then run the FastAPI application in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pipenv run python -m uvicorn meal_mentor.app:app --reload
   ```

## Usage

Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`.

To access Grafana, visit `http://localhost:3000` and log in with the default credentials unless changed in the `.env`
file (username: `admin`, password: `admin`).
The Grafana dashboard.json file is located in the `grafana` folder in the repo. You can import it into Grafana to
visualize the application's performance and user interactions.

  <img src="images/grafana_dashboard_screenshot2.png" width="600">
</p>

To check the content of the database, use `pgcli` (already installed with pipenv):

```bash
pipenv run pgcli -h localhost -U your_username -d meal_mentor -W
```

### API Example

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/question" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "question": "What is a nice healthy Italian recipe?"
         }'
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "conversation_id": "71aea2ea-ad95-4e47-b050-cbce07729faf",
  "question": "What is a nice healthy Italian recipe?",
  "answer": "A nice healthy Italian recipe is the Italian Tomato Tart, which is part of the DASH diet. It has 70.67g of protein, 300.07g of carbs, and 63.38g of fat."
}

## Evaluation

### RAG Evaluation

Two RAG approaches were tested to optimize the integration between the knowledge base and the LLM:

#### **Approach 1**: LLM-as-a-Judge metric on `gpt-4o-mini`

| Relevance       | Count | Proportion |
|-----------------|-------|------------|
| RELEVANT        | 151   | 0.755      |
| PARTLY_RELEVANT | 29    | 0.145      |
| NON_RELEVANT    | 20    | 0.100      |

#### **Approach 2**: LLM-as-a-Judge metric on `gpt-4o`

| Relevance       | Count | Proportion |
|-----------------|-------|------------|
| RELEVANT        | 95    | 0.475      |
| PARTLY_RELEVANT | 76    | 0.380      |
| NON_RELEVANT    | 29    | 0.145      |

The notebook for this evaluation is located at [`notebooks/rag_evaluation.ipynb`](notebooks/rag_evaluation.ipynb), and
the ground truth data used can be found in [
`data/ground-truth-retrieval_4o_mini.csv`](data/ground-truth-retrieval_4o_mini.csv).

**Insight**: Based on these results, **gpt-4o-mini** was chosen due to its higher proportion of fully relevant
responses.

### Retrieval Evaluation

Two retrieval models were each evaluated on two different datasets generated by gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini thus to determine
the optimal approach for indexing and searching the recipe data. Thus making for 4 different evaluations:

#### **Minsearch Evaluation**

For the gpt-4o-mini ground truth dataset:

| Metric   | Value            |
|----------|------------------|
| Hit Rate | 0.898            |
| MRR      | 0.85794126984127 |

For the gpt-4o ground truth dataset:

| Metric   | Value              |
|----------|--------------------|
| Hit Rate | 0.947              |
| MRR      | 0.9229761904761906 |

#### **Elasticsearch Evaluation**

For the gpt-4o-mini ground truth dataset:

| Metric   | Value              |
|----------|--------------------|
| Hit Rate | 0.929              |
| MRR      | 0.9034500000000001 |

For the gpt-4o ground truth dataset:

| Metric   | Value              |
|----------|--------------------|
| Hit Rate | 0.974              |
| MRR      | 0.9506833333333334 |

## Monitoring and Feedback
