## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy diet can be challenging. With an overwhelming number of recipes and dietary information available, finding meals that meet individual nutritional needs and preferences is time-consuming and often frustrating. Meal Mentor aims to simplify this process by providing personalized recipe recommendations based on users' dietary requirements and nutritional goals.

## Problem Description

Many individuals struggle to plan meals that align with their dietary preferences, nutritional goals, and health requirements. Whether someone is following a specific diet like keto, vegan, or Mediterranean, or trying to manage macronutrient intake (e.g., high protein, low carb), finding suitable recipes can be a daunting task.

Existing recipe platforms often lack the ability to provide personalized recommendations that consider both dietary restrictions and specific nutritional values. Users are left to manually sift through countless recipes, which is inefficient and discouraging.

**Meal Mentor** addresses this problem by leveraging advanced technologies to deliver tailored recipe suggestions, enhancing the user experience and promoting healthier eating habits.

## Project Overview

Meal Mentor is an end-to-end application that combines a knowledge base of recipes with powerful search and AI capabilities to provide users with customized meal recommendations. The application uses:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Integrates information retrieval and natural language generation to produce relevant and context-aware responses.
- **OpenAI API**: Utilizes LLMs to interpret user queries and generate personalized recommendations.
- **Elasticsearch**: Implements advanced search functionalities to efficiently retrieve relevant recipes from the knowledge base.
- **FastAPI**: Serves as the backend framework to manage API endpoints and handle user requests.
- **JavaScript and HTML Frontend**: Provides an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores structured data, including recipes, user preferences, and feedback.
- **Grafana**: Monitors system performance, user interactions, and feedback for continuous improvement.

## Features

1. **Personalized Recipe Recommendations**: Suggests recipes based on diet type (e.g., keto, vegan, Mediterranean) and specific nutritional values.
2. **Nutritional Filtering**: Allows users to set macronutrient ranges (e.g., minimum protein, maximum carbs).
3. **Ingredient Inclusion/Exclusion**: Users can specify ingredients to include or exclude in their recommendations.
4. **User Feedback Collection**: Enables users to provide feedback on recommendations to improve the system.
5. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks user interactions and system performance through Grafana dashboards.
6. **Conversational Interface**: Supports natural language queries for an enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.11.
- **OpenAI API**: Accesses advanced LLMs for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Elasticsearch**: Provides robust full-text search and analytics engine for efficient data retrieval.

   ```bash
   python ingest_data.py
   ```

   *Note: Ensure that the Docker containers are running before executing the script.*

## Usage

### Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the Meal Mentor frontend interface.

### Using the API

You can interact with the API directly using tools like `curl` or `Postman`.

**Example: Get Recipe Recommendations**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/recommendations"      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -d '{
           "diet_type": "keto",
           "min_protein": 20,
           "max_carbs": 10,
           "include_ingredients": ["chicken", "spinach"],
           "exclude_ingredients": ["nuts"]
         }'
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "recipes": [
    {
      "title": "Grilled Chicken with Spinach",
      "ingredients": ["chicken breast", "spinach", "olive oil", "garlic"],
      "instructions": "Season the chicken breast with salt and pepper...",
      "nutrition": {
        "calories": 350,
        "protein": 30,
        "carbs": 8,
        "fat": 20
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Frontend Usage

1. **Input Preferences**: Use the interface to select your diet type, set nutritional filters, and specify ingredients to include or exclude.

2. **Get Recommendations**: Click the "Get Recipes" button to receive personalized recipe suggestions.

3. **Provide Feedback**: After trying a recipe, you can submit feedback to help improve the recommendations.

### Monitoring

Access the Grafana dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` to view system metrics and user interaction data.

## Evaluation

### Retrieval Evaluation

To ensure that the most relevant recipes are retrieved based on user queries, multiple retrieval approaches were evaluated:

- **Baseline Retrieval**: Used standard Elasticsearch full-text search without boosting.
- **Improved Retrieval with Boosting**: Adjusted Elasticsearch query to boost fields like diet type, ingredients, and nutritional values.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

- **Hit Rate**: Percentage of queries where relevant recipes were retrieved.
- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Measures how early the relevant recipe appears in the search results.

### RAG Evaluation

Different RAG approaches were tested to optimize the integration between the knowledge base and the LLM:

- **Approach 1**: Simple concatenation of retrieved recipes in the prompt.
- **Approach 2**: Summarizing retrieved recipes before inclusion in the prompt.
- **Approach 3**: Using a template to structure the prompt with key information.

## Monitoring and Feedback

Meal Mentor collects user feedback and monitors system performance to continuously improve the application.

### Grafana Dashboard

The Grafana dashboard displays:

- **User Interactions**: Number of queries, feedback submissions, and active users.
- **System Performance**: API response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
- **Feedback Analysis**: User satisfaction rates and common issues reported.

**Dashboard Metrics Include:**

1. **Total Queries**: Tracks the number of recipe recommendation requests.
2. **Average Response Time**: Monitors the performance of the API.
3. **User Feedback Scores**: Visualizes satisfaction ratings over time.
4. **Error Rates**: Identifies any issues in the system for prompt resolution.
5. **Popular Diet Types**: Shows which diet types are most requested by users.

### Feedback Mechanism

Users can rate the relevance of the recommendations and provide comments. This data is stored in PostgreSQL and used to refine the recommendation algorithms.

## Ingestion Pipeline

An automated ingestion pipeline was implemented to process and index recipe data into the knowledge base.

### Steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Recipes were sourced from open datasets and APIs.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Ensured consistency in data formats and fields.
3. **Indexing**: Recipes were indexed into Elasticsearch with appropriate mappings.
4. **Database Population**: Recipe metadata and user-related data were stored in PostgreSQL.

### Tools Used:

- **Python Scripts**: Automated data processing tasks.
- **Asyncio**: For asynchronous data fetching and processing.
- **Elasticsearch Bulk API**: For efficient indexing of large datasets.
- **Airflow or Prefect (if used)**: For scheduling and managing ingestion workflows.

## Interface

Meal Mentor provides both a user-friendly web interface and a RESTful API.

### Web Interface

- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Responsive design for compatibility with various devices.
- Features intuitive forms for inputting preferences and viewing recommendations.
- Supports natural language queries in addition to structured inputs.

## Containerization

The entire application is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Reproducibility

2. **User Accounts**: Allow users to create profiles to save preferences and history.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Develop recommendation algorithms based on user behavior and feedback.
4. **Integration with Wearables**: Sync with fitness trackers to tailor recommendations based on activity levels.
5. **Mobile Application**: Develop native apps for iOS and Android platforms.
6. **Multi-Language Support**: Extend the application to support multiple languages.
7. **Social Features**: Enable users to share recipes and recommendations with friends.
